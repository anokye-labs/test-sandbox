## Branch Protection Rules

The following rules are enforced on this repository's default branch:

- **Pull request required** — All changes must go through a pull request. Direct pushes to the default branch are blocked.
- **Review required** — At least 1 approving review is required before merging. Stale reviews are dismissed when new commits are pushed.
- **Conversation resolution required** — All PR review comments and conversations must be resolved before merging.
- **Force pushes blocked** — Force pushes to the default branch are not allowed.
- **Branch deletion blocked** — The default branch cannot be deleted.

### Workflow

1. Create a feature branch (use git worktrees when possible)
2. Make changes and commit
3. Open a pull request targeting the default branch
4. Address all review comments and resolve conversations
5. Get at least 1 approval
6. Merge via the PR (squash or merge commit)

Never commit directly to the default branch. Never force push.
